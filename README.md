## Demo

[DEMO](https://sveta-kryukova.github.io/matches-game/)

## Description

The game starts with 25 matches displayed on the table.
Players take turns removing matches from the table.
Only one player can take a turn at a time: either the player or the AI opponent.
The player always starts the game.
On the player's turn, they can select to remove 1, 2, or 3 matches from the table.
On the AI opponent's turn, the game automatically determines the optimal number of matches to remove.
The game continues until all matches are taken from the table.
After the last match is removed, the winner is determined based on the total number of matches each player took.
If the total number of matches taken is even, the player wins. Otherwise, the AI opponent wins.
Once the game is over, the option to play again is displayed.
The game also provides an instructions modal that explains the rules to the players.
The instructions modal is shown on the first visit to the game and can be dismissed by the player.
The game keeps track of the player's total matches and the AI opponent's total matches throughout multiple game rounds.
